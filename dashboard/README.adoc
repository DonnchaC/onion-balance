OnionBalance web dashboard

Requires the Bottle web framework and Python3

The dashboard needs to be run on the same host running OnionBalance
and have read+write permissions to /var/run/onionbalance/control

On Debian:

$ sudo apt-get install python3-bottle

$ ./dashboard.py -h

Set the template path if needed.
